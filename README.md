4 channel lightning module for RC models

The main controller electronic weighs only 1.4g and is populated on a 25 x 28 mm PCB.
In addition you need some wiring and LEDs depending on your configuration.
Enameled wire is the best choice for light weight models.
The module is suitable for big models as well as for ultra micro models such as planes, helicopters, ships, cars, ...

For RC control you only need one channel for controlling 4 independent output channels.
This is implemented as 16 discrete binaary coded channel values.
The RC channel can be mixed on the transmitter, e.g. from 4 switches.
The process how to do this is described in the documentation file (currently only in german).

The lightning patterns of eac output (number, length and pauses) can be programmed via transmitter.
E.g. you can use one channel for landing lights as permanent, another channel for strobe lights flashing 3 times every second, one for navigation lights and one for ACL lights.

If you don't have any free RC channel you can also connect a button to the RC input instead of an RC receiver.
With this you can switch through activating all 4 output channels subsequently.
